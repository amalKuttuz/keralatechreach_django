## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify MySQL connection settings
- Check database user permissions
- Ensure database encoding is set to UTF-8

### Migration Errors
- Run `makemigrations` with `--dry-run` to preview changes
- Check for field type mismatches
- Handle nullable fields appropriately

### File Upload Issues
- Verify media directory permissions
- Check file size limits
- Ensure proper file types are allowed

### API Response Issues
- Use Django Debug Toolbar to analyze queries
- Verify serializer field definitions
- Check JSON response structure
